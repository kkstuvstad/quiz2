# quiz2

Description: For this quiz, I used a city boundaries shapefile for cities in the state of Oregon. This is the most recent edition from 2018. This shapefile was converted to a GeoJSON file, which was reduced in size to about 144 KB. The simplified version smoothed out a lot of the boundaries, giving it many flat edges and reducing the accuracy of each city's boundary. However, the size of this was expanded to about 15 MB. Attached below are each file's respective name and size in bytes.

Name | Size
------|------
citylim_2018.shp              | 4.59 MB
citylim_2018.geojson          | 144 KB
citylim_2018_simplified.json  | 15 MB
